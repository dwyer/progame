When designing levels, keep in mind a few restrictions imposed by the engine. 

* You must save two copies of your tilemap, one .tmx and one .lua. The .lua
  version is the one that the game will load. Unfortately, Tiled doesn't load
  the .lua format, so we must keep a copy of the .tmx.

* Tile size must be 16x16. Other sizes will lead to unexpected behavior.

* Use only one tileset. Ignoring this rule will lead to unexpected behavior.
  [This restriction will probably be lifted in the future.]

* You must place an object layer between the layers you want to distiguish
  between background and foreground. 

* The collision layer must be the topmost layer. If you don't have a collision
  layer, the engine will use your top layer for collision and not draw it. This
  means you must have a collision layer, even if it's empty.
